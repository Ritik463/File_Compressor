Project On File Compression Using Huffman Coding
File compression is the process of reducing the size of a file so that it takes up less storage space and can be transmitted or processed more efficiently. One popular technique for file compression is Huffman coding, which is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm.

Huffman coding works by assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters or symbols in a file, while longer codes are assigned to less frequently occurring symbols. This approach takes advantage of the statistical properties of the input data, aiming to achieve optimal compression by minimizing the average code length.

Here's an overview of the steps involved in Huffman coding for file compression:

Frequency analysis: The first step is to analyze the input file and determine the frequency of occurrence for each symbol or character. Symbols can be individual characters, groups of characters, or any other defined unit in the file.

Building the Huffman tree: Based on the frequency analysis, a Huffman tree is constructed. The tree is a binary tree where each leaf node represents a symbol and the path from the root to a leaf node represents the code for that symbol. The frequency of a symbol determines its position in the tree, with more frequent symbols closer to the root.

Generating the Huffman codes: Starting from the root of the Huffman tree, traverse each path to a leaf node. Assign a '0' for a left branch and '1' for a right branch. The resulting binary codes are the Huffman codes for each symbol.

Encoding the file: Once the Huffman codes are generated, each symbol in the input file is replaced with its corresponding Huffman code. This process results in a compressed representation of the original file, where frequently occurring symbols are represented by shorter codes.

Writing the compressed file: The compressed file is then written using the compressed representation generated in the previous step. In addition to the compressed data, it usually contains some metadata to facilitate decompression, such as the Huffman tree structure or the frequency table.

To decompress the file, the reverse process is performed. The compressed file is read, and the Huffman tree or frequency table is used to decode the Huffman codes back into the original symbols. The decompressed symbols are then written to a new file, which is an exact replica of the original file.

Huffman coding provides effective compression for files with non-uniform symbol distributions. By assigning shorter codes to frequently occurring symbols, it achieves a significant reduction in file size. This compression technique is widely used in various applications, including file compression algorithms like ZIP and GZIP, as well as image and video compression formats such as JPEG and MPEG.
